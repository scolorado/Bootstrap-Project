        <br>
        <p>The Freehold Regional High School District encourages all students to participate fully in the physical education program. It recognizes, however, that some students are engaged in athletic, interscholastic, or other programs of vigorous physical activity, allowing for achievement of the New Jersey Core Curriculum Content Standards. Such students may, pursuant to rules of the State Board of Education, be excused from the required enrollment in a physical education course, while still earning physical education credit. There are three qualifying paths:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Path A (for 10th through 12th graders): Participation in two or more NJSIAA-recognized JV and/or Varsity sports or two seasons of JV/Varsity cheerleading at the high school</li>
          <li>Path B (for 10th through 12th graders): Participation in one NJSIAA-recognized JV or Varsity sport or JV/Varsity cheerleading at the high school, plus documented off-season-training (150 minutes/week) in the same sport/cheer with an organization approved by the principal</li>
          <li>Path C (for 9th through 12th graders): Continuous high-level training, practice, performance, and/or competition in an athletic or physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week with an approved organization, coach, and/or teacher.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Option II activities must provide at least 150 minutes of physical education weekly. Students must have the coach or instructor verify this via a weekly log. Any parent who wishes to exercise the Option II Alternative Physical Education program for a child must submit an online Option II Application. All students who participate are enrolled in a Study Hall and will receive an “S” (Satisfactory) upon successful completion of Option II.</p>
